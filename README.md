👋 About Me
I am a Remote Sensing Professional & Data Scientist with over a decade of hands-on experience spanning research, climate-tech startups, academia, externally funded projects (as Project Investigator), and the insurance sector. My background as a geoscientist has allowed me to work at the intersection of hydrology, geospatial intelligence, remote sensing, and climate applications, with a strong focus on climate risk and catastrophic risk modeling.
My expertise includes:
•	🌍 Climate & Disaster Risk – risk modeling, early warning systems, and emerging risk identification
•	🌱 Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) – biodiversity, resilience, and sustainability strategies
•	📊 Insurance & Finance – agriculture reinsurance, parametric (index-based) solutions, ESG integration, and sustainability reporting
•	🛰️ Geospatial Data & Remote Sensing – Earth observation, geoinformatics, and applied AI for climate

🛰️ Remote Sensing Data I Work With
•	Satellite Data: Landsat, MODIS, AVHRR, VIIRS, SRTM, GRACE, Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, Sentinel-5
•	Applications: Hydrology, agriculture, biodiversity, and climate risk modeling
🛠️ Tools & Technologies
•	Programming & Analysis: Python, R, MATLAB
•	GIS & Geospatial Tools: Google Earth Engine, QGIS, ArcGIS, GDAL
•	Other Areas: Machine learning, climate risk analytics, ESG & sustainability frameworks
