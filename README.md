Obtaining the spatial distribution information of soil organic carbon (SOC) is significant to quantify the carbon budget and guide land management for migrating carbon emissions. Digital soil mapping of SOC at a regional scale is challenging due to the complex SOC-environment relationships. Vegetation phenology that directly indicates a long time vegetation growth characteristics can be potential environmental covariates for SOC prediction. Deep learning has been developed for soil mapping recently due to its ability of constructing high-level features from the raw data.
